Implement the X matrix type which contains integers. These are 
square matrices that can contain nonzero entries only in their two 
diagonals. Don't store the zero entries. Store only the entries that 
can be nonzero in a sequence. Implement as methods: getting the 
entry located at index (i, j), adding and multiplying two matrices, 
and printing the matrix (in a square shape).
